## Replicating all of the files on your local machine
As the files of the website contain CSS, HTML and JavaScript which run without any additional dependencies, you can simply clone the git repo.
```
# Navigate to any folder on your local machine and run
git clone https://github.com/mriusdev/URLOFTHIS
```
